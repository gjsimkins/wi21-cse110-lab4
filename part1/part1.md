1. i is correctly printed because it is a var.
2. discountedPrice is correctly printed because it is a var.
3. The finalPrice is correctly printed because it is declared in the same code block as line 13. 
4. [50,100,150] Because the code works correctly and makes all the prices given half off. 
5. Error because i is a let and i is declared in the for loop and line 11 is not in the for loop.
6. Error because discountedPrice is a let and is declared in the for loop and line 12 is not in the for loop.
7. The finalPrice woudl be correctly printed because it is declared in the same code block as line 13. 
8. Error because it is trying to access let outside of it scope. 
9. Error because i is a let and i is declared in the for loop and line 11 is not in the for loop.
10. Error because discountedPrice is a const and the function tries to change it. 
11. Error because finalPrice is a const and the funciton tries to change it.
12. Error because the function is trying to set const to different values. 
13. - A) student.name
    - B) student['Grad Year']
    - C) student.greeting.call();
    - D) student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    - E) student.courseLoad[0]
14. - A) '32', it appends 2 to the 3 as a string
    - B) 1, it converts '3' to a number and subtracts 2
    - C) 3, 3 is a number and a number plus null is just the number
    - D) '3null' it appends null to the 3 as a string
    - E) 4, true is converted to a number which is 1 plus 3 which is 4
    - F) 0, false and null are converted to numbers which they both equal 0
    - G) '3undefined', undefined is appened to 3 and a string
    - H) Nan, since undefined cannot be converted into a number
15. - A) true, '2' is converted to a number
    - B) false, '12' comes before '2' is dictionary order
    - C) true, '2' is converted to a number
    - D) false, its a strict equality and they are different type
    - E) false, true is converted to a number, 1
    - F) true, 2 is casted to boolean, true
16. == is a regular equality test that will try to cast the types to different types in order to compare but === is a strict equality that only compares without type conversion so two different types would not return true. 
17. How are you?, since in the first if statement true is converted to 1 so it equates to false but the second if statement is just 2 and it is greater than 0 so it equates to true.

19. [6,8,10], As it goes through the array when it pushes onto newArr it calls callback of modifyArray which is doSomething. This then calls its callback which is defined when it is called. doSomething adds 2 to the number then the defined function multiplies it by 2 and then modifyArray puts it into newArr.
